We know the **brain** is a physical organ and the **mind** combines all the mental thoughts, feelings and consciousness.

## Thought

While reading a section of Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari where it mentioned that around 2500BC for storing information there were only handful of instruments available, the most amazing of all was (and is) our **brain** as its the most efficient in retrieving the storage information with the help of our **mind**.
A thought crossed my **mind** while reading how the **mind** can start from a single thought and process all the information relating to it so fast that still remains a mystery. People at that time began to store large amount of information successfully to an extent with the help of quipus but the retrivel was equally a big failure.
Storing and retrieving any information requires two primary things:

1. storage
2. language

A limited requirement was there for storage during that time, as the population, transactions of goods or assets, number of fields or businesses owned, and the math behind all these were far more less than what we today.

Language was then a problem and now after thousands of years humans are still not able to find solace with it. The scripts at that time were not profiecient enough to be used for all the math, laws, news, culture, literature, or general book-keeping.

We dedicate a person or group for doing a single job of storing and another for retrieving that information when required. Information and its processing was an expensive thing at that time. With limited storage instruments and partially developed scripts it was difficult for a group of humans living together to live without conflicts.

## Analogy

As the times changed, humans have created various ways to process information, the most interesting of all today is with the help of Machine Learning and AI. In every century we have tried to invent more and better solution of Information processing. The science behind the most efficient technique is used by computers which is second to our **brains**. In older times humans employed other humans to delegate this task which is now delegated to computers.

Today, Information and its processing is free in a sense or very cheap in cost but then why do we still have conflicts?

Earlier, the deprivation of information and the tools processing it created a conflict in understanding whether that piece of information is valid or not and today after having loads of information stored in most efficient way and getting processed in just a scroll in abundance we still have another form of conflict that which information is true and which is not.

The false has become a truth now.

Information was stored & processed by humans, then Computers replaced humans, then Internet changed Computers and now AI is taking over the Internet.

So the most absurd thing today is that we think that humans will be replaced by AI.

We should not forget that these advancements were an outcome of a group of **brains** who took the responsibility of resolving conflicts between other **minds** who were not able to process information correctly. That was possible with the magic of **brain** and **mind**.

Till the time when humans exists with a brain and mind, we will keep on advancing in technology and also invent new ways of conflicts like fighting over language, culture or religion. With each advancement in Science, a new instrument of entertainment like memes, fake voices or videos with baby face over-lapped with cats will also take relevance.

Religions didn't existed at some point in time, just like fake AI videos but both are very relevant and absurd today. Its all our **brain** and **mind** have created.
